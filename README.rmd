# Web-enabled and Cross-platform SAM via Shiny

___If you are running the Excel version of SAM, you should first try this on a different machine and not clobber
the existing version of SAM. You've been warned.___

First make sure you have a very recent version of R or RStudio.

Next install required packages. Cut and paste what's below in an R session.

```{r}
install.packages(c("samr", "matrixStats", "GSA", "shiny", "openxlsx"))
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("impute")
```
You only need to do this once.

Then, you may run SAM any time in an R session as follows.

```{r}
library(shiny)
runGitHub("SAM", "MikeJSeo")
```

That will bring up a browser window with a user interface. More details are provided in the manual sam.pdf in this directory

Please post to the group regarding any issues. This will help us ensure we have all the kinks ironed out before merging the code 
into the next version of the `samr` package.

Thank you,
